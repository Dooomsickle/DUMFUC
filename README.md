# DUMFUC
### ***Doom's Unity Modding Framework with Useful Content***
DUMFUC is a BepInEx mod framework that aims to make modding (IL2CPP) VR games easier.
It's designed to be completely game-agnostic, so code that works in one project should work in another with minimal changes.

I tried to make the features as generic as possible, but a lot of them are specifically for my needs. You may still find them useful.
